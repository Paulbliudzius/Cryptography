# Cryptography Helper
A Page of JavaScript Code that I used in my class for Cryptography. By: Paul Bliudzius
Everything was done on one page with no pretty layouts in HTML and JavaScript.
##Includes:
* Modular Inverse
* GCD ( Greatest Common Divisors )
* Affine Cipher
* Vigenere Cipher
* DES Encryption ( Data Encryption Standard )
* SHA Algorithm ( Secure Hash Algorithm )

##Website
You can use it directly from: www.bliudzius.com/cryptography

I have no intention of working on this anymore, so please feel free to add to it as you wish. The code used is directed towards indiviudal assignments in my class. This was used to learn how the algorithms worked and to help solve them.
